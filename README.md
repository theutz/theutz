Hello! Iâ€™m Michael Utz, currently living in Turkey but originally from the United States. Iâ€™ve been involved in web development since 2008, starting my career in front-end development and gradually expanding my skills to include full-stack development, devops, and infrastructure. I enjoy the challenges that come with evolving technologies and take pride in creating effective web solutions. Outside of work, I like to explore new places and appreciate the local culture here in Turkey.
